## Description
_________________________________________________________________
* Danny's Hangman is a one-player game based on the traditional two-player hangman game.  

## Technologies Used
_________________________________________________________________
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Getting Started
_________________________________________________________________
* https://dmay08.github.io/hangman
1) User selects a category, which generates a random word from that category. 
2) To guess the word, user clicks letters that he/she believes are in the chosen word. 
3) User has a maximum of 6 incorrect guesses to correctly guess the word and win, otherwise player loses. 
4) User can click "Play again" to reset the game.  

## Next Steps
_________________________________________________________________
* Going forward, I would like to create a more detailed "hangman" image (7 images total) to be displayed when the user guesses an incorrect letter. I would also like to make categories for different levels of difficulty.
